Subject: Commodity Exchange Act Passes Congress
X-SDOC: 233647

Multilateral Transactions

In addition, the Act creates a broad exemption for any agreement, contract or 
transaction in commodities (other than agriculture commodities) so long as 
they the transactions are between "eligible commercial participants", are 
entered into on a "principle-to-principle basis" and that take place on a 
multi-party "electronic facility".  This exemption could facilitate expansion 
of EnronOnline to allow for multi-party transactions, however certain legal 
requirements will have to be met.

Other Transactions

The Act also creates a broad exclusion for a number of commodities that are 
of interest to Enron, including "credit risk measure" commodities and weather 
derivatives .  Again, the derivative transaction exclusion will have to meet 
certain legal thresholds.

This legislation has been over six years in the making and the collective 
support of many Enron employees has been crucial.  Thank you to all that have 
contributed to the passage on this important legislation.  We will have a 
more through legal summary of this legislation in the near future. Do not 
hesitate to contact me at (202) 466- 9158 of Mark Taylor at (713) 853-7459 
with any questions.
